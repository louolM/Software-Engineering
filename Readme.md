# EasySave

A lightweight console backup tool written in C# / .NET 10.  
EasySave lets users define up to 5 backup jobs, each copying files from a source directory to a target directory using either a Full or Differential strategy. Every run is logged to a daily JSON file and its live progress is written to a state file that external monitors can poll.
